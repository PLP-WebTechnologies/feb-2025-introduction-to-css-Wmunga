               <p>When I got a call from my friend about an opportunity, I decided to give it a go. I was a graduate already, with no job or anything keeping me busy, and depression was silently making its way into my life. Though the course i did had nothing to do with software development, I decided to give it a go. After all, what was the worst that could ever happen?</p>
               <p class="highlight">It turned out that this was the one of the best decisions I ever made.</p>
